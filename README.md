## 📘 Overview

This project analyzes real-world air pollution data using Python. It focuses on understanding pollutant trends, identifying seasonal patterns, and detecting anomalies to derive meaningful environmental insights.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- 🧹 Clean and preprocess raw pollution data  
- 📊 Visualize pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂) over time  
- 🧭 Analyze trends and peak pollution periods  
- 🕵️ Detect anomalies and irregularities in air quality  
- 📝 Generate insights for environmental awareness and decision-making
